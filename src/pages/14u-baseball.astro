            The <strong>Manheim Lions 14U Baseball Team</strong> has been a proud community tradition for decades and is one of the longest-running youth programs supported by the Manheim Lions Club. Through our sponsorship, we help provide uniforms, equipment, and support for local athletes as they learn the value of teamwork, sportsmanship, and community pride.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Competing in the <strong>14U age division</strong>, the team represents Manheim in regional leagues each spring and summer. The program gives young athletes the opportunity to build their skills, form lasting friendships, and develop leadership both on and off the field. Many former players have gone on to coach, volunteer, and give back to the same program that helped shape their early years.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The Manheim Lions are honored to continue sponsoring the team and investing in the next generation of players who embody the Lions’ spirit of commitment, perseverance, and service. Both on and off the field.
